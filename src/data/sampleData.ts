        answerText: "Not telling my grandfather how much I appreciated him before he passed away. We were very close when I was growing up - he taught me how to fish, how to fix things around the house, and would tell me stories about his life growing up during difficult times. As I got older and busier with college and starting my career, I visited less and less. When he got sick, I kept thinking there would be more time to have those meaningful conversations, to thank him for everything he taught me. But his condition deteriorated quickly, and by the time I made it home, he wasn't conscious anymore. I sat with him and talked, but I'll never know if he heard me. That was five years ago and it still haunts me that I prioritized everything else over those last potential conversations.",
